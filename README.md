# NBA-Projects / Jacob Yablonski

All the code uploaded onto my Github is using R.  I'm relatively new to the language but i've enjoyed learning it and improving my skills with it.  I'm familiar with using the Tidyverse (specifically dplyr, readr, ggplot2), GGanimate, and Caret Packages.  I have a working knowledge of many machine learning algorithms and techniques but I mostly just put visualization code on here.  

Below are a handful of visualizations I have created, along with my thoughts / general insights derived from them where applicable.  NBA data is enjoyable for me to work with because it's probably my biggest hobby, and all sorts of data is easy to pull and also readily available.

To me, this was the most interesting animation I created.  It's fascinating looking at the history of the league, seeing the steady rise of the 3-point shot, and the variability of the League Average TS% over the years. 

You can see that between 1999-2004, the League Average TS% was at its lowest point in the last 25+ years.  It was also relatively low in 2012, which was the last lockout year.

[The NBA allowing zones starting in the 2001-2002 Season](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/2001/04/13/nba-approves-zone-defenses-other-changes/b9126ae0-f1b9-4a35-bb3e-a3ea86251375/) probably contributed to lowering the League Average TS% for a couple of seasons.  Teams hadnâ€™t figured out how to properly space the floor, superstars could now legally be shadowed / double teamed, and efficient 3-point shooters were very difficult to find or develop.  

[Hand Check rules were eliminated following the 2003-2004 Season](https://slate.com/culture/2006/11/the-nba-hasn-t-become-a-league-dominated-by-offense.html), which probably helped boost the League Average TS% by making it easier for offensive players to score the basketball.

The insights to be drawn here are that the NBA Draft is very unpredicatable and up and down, some years you will have a handful of standout players and other years there will be an overall lack of good talent.  There is also an increasing trend of 3PA each season, rookies coming in are expected to be shooting three pointers and those who can't shoot are generally at a significant disadvantage in terms of being able to stay in the league.

This was just a quick graphic to show the absurdity of James Harden in the 2018-2019 NBA Regular Season.  He drew more fouls on three point attempts than any other team COMBINED last season.

Only 5 Teams averaged more Personal Fouls in Wins than Losses.
